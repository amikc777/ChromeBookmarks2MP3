# YouTube to MP3 Converter

## Overview

This project is a simple YouTube to MP3 converter application built using Python and Tkinter.
It allows users to input a YouTube video URL and download the corresponding audio track in MP3 format.

In addition to the standalone converter, the project aims to expand into a Chrome bookmarks scrapper. 
This feature will parse through a bookmark folder, identify YouTube video URLs,
and automatically download the associated songs in MP3 format.

## Features

- Input a YouTube video URL and download the audio track in MP3 format.
- Display download status and any errors encountered during the download process.
- Expandable functionality for parsing Chrome bookmarks and downloading YouTube videos directly from bookmarked URLs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTube library (for downloading YouTube videos)
- Tkinter library (for GUI)
- CustomTkinter library (for custom-styled Tkinter widgets)

## Future Enhancements

- Implement Chrome bookmarks scrapper functionality to automate the process of downloading YouTube videos from bookmarked URLs.
- Add support for batch processing multiple YouTube URLs from a text file or CSV.
- Improve user interface with additional features such as progress bars and download statistics.
